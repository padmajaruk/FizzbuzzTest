### RUN
Using build file 

- source run.sh

OR 

- mvn clean install


##The problem

Please write code delivering the requirements of the steps that follow. 

###Step 1:

Write a class that produces the following for any contiguous range of integers:

the number
‘fizz’ for numbers that are multiples of 3
‘buzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 5
‘fizzbuzz’ for numbers that are multiples of 15
Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.

e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Archive this as a separate .zip file then continue on to step two.

###Step 2:

Please enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:

If the number contains a three you must output the text ‘lucky’. This overrides any existing behaviour
e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

Archive this as a separate .zip file then continue on to step three.

###Step 3:

Finally, please enhance your existing solution to perform the following:

Produce a report at the end of the output showing how many times the following were printed:
fizz
buzz
fizzbuzz
lucky
an integer
e.g. Running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:

1 2 lucky 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz lucky 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz fizz: 4 buzz: 3 fizzbuzz: 1 lucky: 2 integer: 10

(Integer is 10 because there were 10 numbers that were not altered).
